# Contributing to a GitHub project

The easiest way to make changes to a GitHub project is with a [pull request](#pull_request) from a [fork](#forking).

## Forking

Click on the "Fork" button on the project you want to fork.

Choose your personal space (or a team space?):

After chugging away, you will have your personal fork.

## Clone your forked repo and do your work

Even though the fork is your own personal space, you should still work under a named feature branch.

## When ready start a pull request from your branch
